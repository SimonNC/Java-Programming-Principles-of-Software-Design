# What I learned from this module
1. implement several sorting algorithms from scratch,
1. use efficient pre-existing sorting classes,
1. modify a classâ€™s compareTo method to choose the criteria by which objects of that type are ordered, and
1. write classes that implement the Comparator interface to create interchangeable sorting criteria.
